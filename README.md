In order to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code you have to write in a OO style. I have pretty much always written in this way as I am lazy and don't want to rewrite my code. Having the CRUD module i created allowed my to reduce redundant and rewritten code drastically. I will for sure be using it in the future for my projects to read and edit databases in mongo. As a computer scientist, you have to approach problems very logically. Without a logical standpoint, you will never be able to solve the problems you face. In the future I will be writing nearly all of my queries in Mongodb using python. I found it much much easier as it is something I already know. Answering what a computer scientist does is tricky. In general I believe that a true computer scientist creates new and innovative ways for the world to interact with technology. The database that we created is a can help the company drastically by speeding up the process of parsing through all of their data.
